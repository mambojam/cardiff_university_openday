This is simple front-end design for an open day at Cardiff University

To run the program, please:
- Download the files or clone the repo to your machine
- Navigate to the directory in your command line
- Run the app.py file using "python app.py"
- You will need python and Flask installed in your venv
- Once the program is running, navigate to the local host port (should be 5000 for Flask) in your web browser and you will be able to access the page
